# Homebrewing Calculator

This is a WinForms project intended to illustrate my progress as a c# developer.
The project began in a separate repository - the first set of commits were made in a subfolder of the project, and thus did not contain several key files (.sln, etc).

Between the two repositories, this project also contains several "false" commits -- very few changes (if any), or the same commit with a message change.
I'll be keeping all of this in place intentionally to show every step of my development, including any mistakes I make. 

## Progression

Over time, this simple app will showcase the following:
- Progressively more sophisticated/cleaner code
- Design patters & principles (while attempting to not over-engineer the code)
- Implementation of a development process (azure DevOps)
- The abstraction of general program logic from WinForms-specific logic into a class library (for future use in web app, possibly WPF app)
- Unit testing
- An installer
- CI/CD pipeline via azure DevOps

..and possibly others!
